# BoomerangInventory
This web application was used to track inventory for a small business with manager and worker logins. The type of account has different permissions for the type of user, with managers having the ability to edit products and minimums. Workers only have permission to add the current amount for each product.

This application was run locally using XAMPP. The database configuration file has been excluded for privacy reasons.
